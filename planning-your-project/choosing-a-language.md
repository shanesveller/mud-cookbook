# Choosing a Language

There are several programming languages that might lend themselves well to the
runtime characteristics of a multi-player game server. Here are several popular
ones being used within the MUD Coders Guild community, as well as some pointers
for what those developers feel the language brings to the table:

# C

# C++

> [C++][cpp] is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing the design
> and use of type-rich, lightweight abstractions. It is particularly suited for
> resource-constrained applications, such as those found in software
> infrastructures.

# C#

> [C#][csharp] (pronounced "See Sharp") is a simple, modern, object-oriented,
> and type-safe programming language. C# has its roots in the C family of
> languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript
> programmers.

# Elixir

> [Elixir][elixir] is a dynamic, functional language designed for building
> scalable and maintainable applications.

# Go

> [Go][golang] is an open source programming language that makes it easy to
> build simple, reliable, and efficient software.[<8;45;37m]

# Python

> [Python][python] is a programming language that lets you work quickly and
> integrate systems more effectively.

# Rust

> [Rust][rust] is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast,
> prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.
